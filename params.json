It gives programmers the comfort of modern syntax but compiles to Bash, resulting in good portability (in as much as Bash is portable).\r\n\r\nCurrently, Bish is still a very new language. I am adding new features as fast as I can, but it is bound not to support something you might like. In that case, see if you can implement it and submit a pull request!\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I won't stop you, but you would probably be crazy to use Bish in any sort of production environment until it stabilizes a bit more.\r\n\r\nSome small examples are below, but **see the [introduction](https://github.com/tdenniston/bish/wiki) wiki page for a more comprehensive introduction**.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n##### Function calls\r\n\r\n    def fib(n) {\r\n        if (n < 2) {\r\n            return 1\r\n        }\r\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n##### Shell commands\r\n\r\n    def printall(files) {\r\n        for (f in files) {\r\n            println(f)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    # cwd, ls, and cd are all builtin functions.\r\n    dir = cwd()\r\n    files = ls()\r\n    println(\"Files in current directory $dir:\")\r\n    printall(files)\r\n    cd(\"/\")\r\n    println(\"Files in root directory:\")\r\n    printall(ls());\r\n\r\n##### Shell-like features\r\n\r\n    # I/O redirection (like pipes) is a first-class language feature.\r\n    pattern = \"bish\"\r\n    matches = ls() | @(grep $pattern)\r\n    println(\"Files in current directory matching $pattern:\")\r\n    for (m in matches) {\r\n        println(m)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## How\r\n\r\n[Download](https://github.com/tdenniston/bish/releases/tag/v0.1) the latest stable release, or clone the repository for the latest and greatest.\r\n\r\nBuild with 'make'. There are no dependencies other than the C++ standard library (and make itself). Compile a bish program to bash with the command:\r\n\r\n    $ ./bish input.bish > output.bash\r\n    \r\nThen run the compiled file:\r\n\r\n    $ bash output.bash\r\n\r\nYou can also perform this in a single step by using the `-r` (for \"run\") argument:\r\n\r\n    $ ./bish -r input.bish\r\n    \r\nThis compiles and pipes the output directly to a bash process.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nI can't count the number of times when I wanted to write a quick shell script to automate an easy task, only to waste hours tracking down idiosyncrasies in Bash syntax and semantics. Bish tries to fill this niche: when you want a lightweight shell scripting language and don't wish to break out the larger hammer of Python, Perl, etc...\r\n\r\nHowever, I created this language first and foremost as a weekend project and exercise in writing a compiler from scratch. I've dealt with pieces of compilers before, but have never written one from start to finish. Thus, I hope this project can also serve as a good teaching tool. I tried to design it with clarity in mind, so it should be simple to extend the language, or write a new back end.\r\n\r\n## News\r\n\r\n* Apr 20 2015 -- Bish version 0.1 released. This is the first tagged release for bish.\r\n* Apr 8 2015 -- I've been caught up in my day job recently, and a few of the features I want to implement before doing a 0.1 release are requiring more infrastructure work than I anticipated. I'm hoping to do a 0.1 release within the next week or two weeks.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n\r\nThe language and compiler are pretty bare-bones as of now, but quite functional. There are numerous things in the pipeline (see the open issues for a list). Longer term, here are some ideas of features that might be implemented:\r\n\r\n* Additional compiler targets, e.g. `sh` for even wider compatability, or `ksh` for vanilla AIX support.\r\n* Multidimensional arrays, and potentially arrays of mixed types.\r\n* Syntactical sugar for more shell-like function invocation. For example, typing `cd(\"path\")` or `ls(\"-l\")` might get old when writing bish scripts. Bish could support an alternate invocation syntax of `function arg0 arg1...` so that these functions could be invoked like `cd path` or `ls -l` directly in the bish script.\r\n* Language support for executing portions of bish scripts as other users (e.g. the administrator).\r\n* Language support for executing commands on remote machines.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
